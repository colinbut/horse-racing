Design Designs

1. Upon invalid data entry, the program will halt and print out error message onto system.out then exit (requiring to restart again)

2. Input not read in from system.in and is provided either: 
- on compile time in the programâ€™s start-up class KentuckyDerby.java 
- in unit test cases

3. Output written to system.out

4. Currently, program provides error handling for the following:
   	- Ball Throw line not in correct format (1 60)
	- Lanes does not exceed maximum allowed in game (7)
	- Valid holes 

5. Ignores invalid lane number in Ball Throw input lines e.g. [7 10]
